p = 3/4

# Part 2:Bayesian network construction 
### Function BNcreate() takes two arguments
#### -Kinship2 pedigree object
#### -transmission probability of rare variant

Kinship2 Pedigree object with their plot
```{r}
library(kinship2)
data("sample.ped")

pedAll = pedigree(id = sample.ped$id, dadid = sample.ped$father, momid = sample.ped$mother, 
                   sex = sample.ped$sex, famid = sample.ped$ped)
print(pedAll)
ped1basic = pedAll["1"]
ped2basic = pedAll["2"]

#### 
pedfile_total = sample.ped
pedfile_2 = pedfile_total[1:41,]
pedfile = pedfile_total[42:55,]
pedfile
####
print(ped1basic)
print(ped2basic)
plot(ped2basic)
plot(ped1basic)

```

Write a function BNcreate() to create a Bayesian network 
```{r}

BNcreate = function(pedfile, tau){
  
  geno_prob = c(
    # 000 100 200 010 110 210 020 120 220
    1, 0, 0, 1-tau, tau, 0, 0, 1, 0,
    # 001 101 201 011 111 211 021 121 221
    1-tau, tau, 0, (1-tau)^2, 2*tau*(1-tau), tau^2, 0, 1-tau, tau,
    # 002 102 202 012 112 212 022 122 222
    0, 1, 0, 0, 1-tau, tau, 0, 0, 1
  )
   
  # if columns of father and mother are lablled 0, which means they are founders, create cptables for founders first
   founders = which(pedfile[, "father"] == 0) # the row number of founders
   founders_vec = rep(0, length(founders)) # store the id numbder of founders (for debugging)
   founders_cpt = list() # store the cptable of founders, which is denoted as [[i]]
   for (i in 1:length(founders)) {
     id = pedfile[founders[i], "id"]
     founders_vec[i] = id
     node = cptable(c(id), values = rep(1/3, 3), levels = copy) 
     # this id node will be applied to setEvidence function later
     founders_cpt[i] = list(node)
   }
  
   pedfile_c = pedfile[-c(founders), ] # dataset removing founders 
   family_ids = list() ## for debugging
   nonfounders_cpt = list()
   for (i in 1:nrow(pedfile_c)) {
     family_ids[i] = list(c(pedfile_c[i, 'id'], pedfile_c[i, "father"], pedfile_c[i, "mother"])) 
     c = pedfile_c[i, 'id']
     f = pedfile_c[i, "father"]
     m = pedfile_c[i, "mother"]
     node_nf = cptable(c(c, f, m), values = geno_prob, levels = copy)
     #debug for the c,f,m here, they are specified more than once

   gin = grain(plist)
   return(gin)

}

# create and return the bayesian network from the list of CPTs (family ped file)

```

# Part3: Likelihood Function construction
### Function likehd takes 3 arguments:
#### - Kinship2 pedigree object specifying ped structure
#### - Transmission probability of rare variant
#### - Rare variant configuration of affected individuals 
```{r}
likehd = function(pedfile, tau, config){
  
  gin = BNcreate(pedfile, tau)
  likelihood = 0
  
  founders = which(pedfile[, "father"] == 0) # the row number of founders
  founders_vec = rep(0, length(founders)) # store the id numbder of founders
  for (i in 1:length(founders)) {
    id = pedfile[founders[i], "id"] # id number of founders
    founders_vec[i] = as.character(id)
  }
  
  affected = which(pedfile[, "affected"] == 1)
  affected_vec = rep(0, length(affected)) 
  # store the id number of affected individuals
  for (i in 1:length(affected)) {
    id = pedfile[affected[i], "id"]
    affected_vec[i] = as.character(id)
  }
  
  print(affected_vec)
  for (i in 1:length(founders)) {
    state = rep("0", length(founders))
    state[i] = "1" # Assume only one founder introduces the rv at a time 
    print(state) # 1 means which founder introduces the rare variant
    bn = setEvidence(gin, nodes = founders_vec, states = state) 
    # which founder introduces the rv, assuming only one introduced at a time
    bn_find = setFinding(bn, nodes = affected_vec, states = config)
    # calculate P(configuration | which founder introduced the rv)
    p = pFinding(bn_find) 
    # The probability of observing the finding is obtained with pFinding()
    print(p)
    likelihood = p*1/length(founders)+likelihood 
  }
  
  return(likelihood)
}

# Part4: Test likelihood function with different pedigrees
### 4.1 Toy Pedigree
```{r}
id = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11)
father = c(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 5, 5)
mother = c(0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 4, 6, 6)
sex = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2)
affected = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1) 
toyPed = cbind(id, father, mother, sex, affected)
toy_config = c("1", "1", "1")

likehd(toyPed, 3/4, toy_config)

```

### 4.2 More complex pedigree with differnt configurations
```{r}
config1 = c("1", "0", "1", "1", "1")
likehd(pedfile, 3/4, config1)

config2 = c("0", "1", "1", "0", "1")
likehd(pedfile, 3/4, config2)

config3 = c("1", "1", "0", "0", "0")
likehd(pedfile, 3/4, config3)
```

# Part5: Plot likelihood function VS tau values
Use likelihood function with different value of tau, plot likelihood function VS tau values
Check the curve with different configurations

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
